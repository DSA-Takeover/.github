The plain truth is: This is a goldmine to help you take over the entire DSA knowledge.

This book include:
* Chapters covering all core domains in Data Structures and Algorithms
* Each chapter is a CHEATSHEET. It includes time & space complexity table, to-the-point explanation and C++ code snippets.
* Each problem can be covered quickly in at most 4 minutes.
* Over 250 coding problems have been covered.

With this, you will be able to crack any Coding Interview easily.

After reading this book, you will:

* Master Data Structures and Algorithms.
* Clear interviews for full-time positions at high-tech companies (good enough for L3, L4 at Google).
* On going through this book, you do not need to solve 1000s of problems from Leetcode by spending over two years. Follow this book, practice the problems and ace every coding interview. Be wise.

This book is for:
* Students and developers preparing for Coding Interviews.
* Developers who wanted to tune their Data Structures and Algorithms skills.
* Students who need a coding sheet to revise DSA topics quickly.
* Get started with this book and change the equation of your career.
